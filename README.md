# node-http-server
Simple Node.js HTTP server demonstration URL routing and request logging.

"This repository contains a simple Node.js HTTP server that demonstrates basic URL routing and request logging functionalities. The server listens for incoming requests, handles different URL paths (/, /about, /search), and logs each request to a log.txt file. It uses Node.js core modules (http, fs, url) for server creation, file system operations, and URL parsing. This example serves as a foundation for understanding server-side routing and request handling in Node.js."
